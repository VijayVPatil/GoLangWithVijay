# If-Else Theory

IF-ELSE are used for conditional flow of the program

1. Basic syntax using if: If statement evaluates the condition and based of if its true then executes the block else skips the block. 
```
if condition{

}
```
Example:
if 1<3 {
    fmt.Println("The block is executed)
}

2. We can also have a else block which will get executed if conditon does not statisy.
